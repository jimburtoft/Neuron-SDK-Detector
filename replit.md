# Overview

‚úÖ **COMPLETED**: AWS Neuron SDK Version Detection Tool is a fully functional Python CLI application that identifies and analyzes AWS Neuron SDK installations across different environments. The tool successfully:

- üîç **Detects System Packages**: Uses dpkg to find installed AWS Neuron system packages
- üêç **Scans Python Environments**: Identifies Neuron packages in current and virtual environments
- üìä **Compares Package Versions**: Matches detected packages against comprehensive SDK database
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Identifies Mixed Installations**: Detects when packages from multiple SDK versions are present
- ‚ùå **Highlights Unknown Versions**: Emphasizes package versions not found in any known SDK
- üìÅ **Multi-Environment Support**: Scans virtual environments in `/opt` directory
- ü§ñ **Simple & Verbose Modes**: Provides both quick version check and detailed package analysis

The tool addresses the complexity of AWS Neuron SDK's multi-package architecture where different components may have different version numbers within the same SDK release.

# User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

# System Architecture

## Core Components

The application follows a modular architecture with clear separation of concerns:

**Main Controller (`neuron_version_detector.py`)**
- Command-line interface and argument parsing
- Orchestrates the detection and analysis workflow
- Handles output formatting (simple vs verbose modes)

**Package Detection (`package_detector.py`)**
- Scans system packages using dpkg commands
- Detects Python packages in current and virtual environments
- Supports multi-environment scanning in `/opt` directory
- Uses predefined package prefixes to identify Neuron-related components

**Version Database Management (`version_database.py`)**
- Manages local JSON database of SDK versions and package mappings
- Downloads database from GitHub when local copy is unavailable
- Builds reverse lookup maps for efficient package-to-SDK version matching
- Handles database updates and caching

**Web Scraping (`scraper.py`)**
- Scrapes AWS Neuron documentation for package version information
- Extracts data from current and previous release pages
- Uses trafilatura for content extraction and requests for HTTP handling
- Maintains session state with appropriate user-agent headers

## Data Flow Architecture

1. **Detection Phase**: Package detector scans system and Python environments
2. **Database Loading**: Version database loads from local file or downloads from remote source
3. **Analysis Phase**: Detected packages are matched against known SDK releases
4. **Output Generation**: Results formatted based on verbosity settings

## Error Handling Strategy

- Graceful degradation when database is unavailable
- Fallback to local files when remote resources fail
- Mixed installation detection for inconsistent environments
- Unknown version warnings for unrecognized packages

## Command-Line Interface Design

Simple default behavior with progressive disclosure through optional flags:
- Default: Simple version output
- `--verbose`: Detailed package information
- `--check-venvs`: Extended environment scanning
- `--update-db`: Database maintenance operations

# External Dependencies

## Third-Party Python Libraries

**trafilatura** - Web content extraction library for parsing AWS documentation pages with intelligent content detection and cleanup.

**requests** - HTTP client library for downloading version database and scraping documentation with session management and timeout handling.

## System Dependencies

**dpkg** - Debian package management system used for detecting installed system packages on Ubuntu/Debian systems.

**subprocess** - Python standard library for executing system commands and parsing dpkg output.

## External Data Sources

**AWS Neuron Documentation** - Primary source for package version information, scraped from:
- Current release page: `awsdocs-neuron.readthedocs-hosted.com/en/latest/release-notes/releasecontent.html`
- Previous releases page: `awsdocs-neuron.readthedocs-hosted.com/en/latest/release-notes/prev/content.html`

**GitHub Repository** - Default location for version database JSON file hosting at `raw.githubusercontent.com/jimburtoft/Neuron-What-Am-I/main/neuron_versions.json`.

## Environment Dependencies

**Virtual Environment Support** - Scans Python virtual environments in `/opt` directory structure commonly used in AWS EC2 instances and DLAMI installations.

**Ubuntu/Debian Systems** - Primary target platform using apt/dpkg package management, specifically tested on Ubuntu 22 LTS systems.
