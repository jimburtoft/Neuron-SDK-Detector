# AWS Neuron SDK Management Suite

## Overview

The AWS Neuron SDK Management Suite is a comprehensive Python CLI toolset designed to detect, analyze, and update AWS Neuron SDK packages across system and virtual environments. The project addresses the complexity of managing the AWS Neuron SDK, which consists of multiple system and Python packages with different versioning schemes across various SDK releases.

The suite provides three main tools:
1. **Detection Tool** (`neuron_detector.py`) - Identifies installed Neuron packages and matches them to SDK releases
2. **Update Script Generator** (`neuron_update.py`) - Creates intelligent update scripts for specific SDK versions
3. **Database Management** (`neuron_database_updater.py`) - Scrapes AWS documentation to maintain version databases

## User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

## System Architecture

### Core Components

**Package Detection Engine**
- Multi-source package detection supporting both system packages (apt/dpkg/rpm) and Python packages (pip)
- Virtual environment scanning with selective targeting in `/opt` directory
- Anchor-based detection using neuronx-cc/neuron-cc versions as authoritative SDK indicators
- Mixed installation detection to identify packages from multiple SDK versions

**Version Database System**
- JSON-based package version database (`neuron_versions.json`) containing 37+ SDK versions
- Auto-download mechanism from GitHub when database is not found locally
- Documentation scraping system using trafilatura for extracting package versions from AWS Neuron documentation
- Local caching for offline use

**Update Script Generation**
- Package manager auto-detection (apt vs yum) with proper repository setup
- Intelligent script generation supporting both upgrades and downgrades
- Version wildcard handling for repository version suffixes
- Held package detection and management
- Virtual environment update support

**CLI Interface**
- Multiple output modes: simple, verbose, script-friendly, and information modes
- Visual indicators for out-of-date and unknown packages
- Direct script execution capability (`python3 neuron_update.py | bash`)

### Data Architecture

**Package Classification**
- System packages: Neuron packages installed via system package managers
- Python packages: Neuron packages installed via pip in various environments
- Known package prefixes for both system and Python package detection

**Version Matching Algorithm**
- SDK version detection based on installed package versions
- Closest version detection for unknown packages
- Mixed installation analysis across multiple SDK versions

**Database Schema**
- Hierarchical structure: SDK version → Platform (Inf1/Inf2/Trn1) → Package → Version
- Release date tracking for chronological analysis
- Platform-specific package version mapping

### Testing Framework

**Comprehensive Test Suite**
- Functional tests based on real-world AWS Neuron system examples
- Package detection regression tests
- Update script generation validation
- Mock-based testing for system command interactions

## External Dependencies
